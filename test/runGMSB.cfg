# please note the IMPORTANT:

# (pileup modeling), at least in the 0-pileup mode
#

# no-pileup, low luminosity pileup, and high luminosity pileup
#
# they come, respectively, through the 3 config fragments below
#
# *each* config returns label "mix"; thus you canNOT have them
# all together in the same configuration, but only one !!!
